# Welcome to ROOHY C++ Framework

ROOHY C++ Framework furnish a set of open-source tools for modelling multi-step dynamics on multiplex network. Within these libraries, programer can create its own model built upon multiplex network without reprogramming from scratch the already generic structure related to multiplex dynamics. This framework works on directed multiplex network and can be extended according to the modelling purpose.

ROOHY C++ is a cross-platform framework.

Features
--------
  - Coding your own model
  - Directed complex network as list of directed edges
  - Closs-platform framework
